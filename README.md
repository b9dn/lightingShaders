### Phong Reflection Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Phong reflection model in Raylib, using shaders to simulate light reflections on four spheres placed within the scene. Two approaches:
1. **Classic Phong** - traditional Phong light reflection model equasion.
2. **Modified Phong** - a customized modification of the Phong model.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Download and set up Raylib.
2. Create `include` and `lib` directories in your project location and copy appropriate files from Raylib.
3. Execute the command in the `make.ps1` file or use `CMake` to build the project.
